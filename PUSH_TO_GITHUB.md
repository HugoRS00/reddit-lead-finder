# 🚀 Final Step: Push to GitHub

Your repository is configured and ready! Since I can't access the network, you'll need to complete the final push from your local machine.

## Option 1: Push From Your Local Machine (Recommended)

### Step 1: Download the Project
Download the entire `reddit_lead_finder` folder from this conversation.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Folder
```bash
cd /path/to/reddit_lead_finder
```

### Step 3: Add Remote (if not already added)
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/HugoRS00/reddit-lead-finder.git
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted to authenticate. Use one of these methods:

**Method A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Generate token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. When prompted for password, paste the token

**Method B: GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if you haven't
gh auth login
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Download and Re-initialize Locally

If the git configuration doesn't transfer properly:

### Step 1: Download the Project Files
Download all files from the `reddit_lead_finder` folder.

### Step 2: Initialize Fresh Git Repo
```bash
cd reddit_lead_finder
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Reddit Lead Finder for TradingWizard.ai"
```

### Step 3: Add Remote and Push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/HugoRS00/reddit-lead-finder.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ What's Already Done

## 🔐 Authentication Troubleshooting

### "Support for password authentication was removed"
→ Use a Personal Access Token instead of your password

### "Permission denied"
→ Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
→ Verify you have write access to the repository

### "Repository not found"
→ Check that the repository exists at: https://github.com/HugoRS00/reddit-lead-finder
→ Ensure you're authenticated

## 🎯 After Successful Push

Once pushed, complete these steps:

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets (Required for Automation)
- Go to: https://github.com/HugoRS00/reddit-lead-finder/settings/secrets/actions
- Add `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
- Add `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions
- Go to: https://github.com/HugoRS00/reddit-lead-finder/actions
- Click "Enable workflows"

### 3. Test Manual Run
- Go to Actions → "Reddit Lead Finder - Scheduled Scan"
- Click "Run workflow"
- Select "main" branch
- Verify it runs successfully
