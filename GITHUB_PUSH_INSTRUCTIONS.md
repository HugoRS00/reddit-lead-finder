# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Step-by-Step Instructions

Your Reddit Lead Finder is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added and committed
- ✅ Branch named 'main'
- ✅ Initial commit created with full changelog

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (2 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in repository details**:
   - **Repository name**: `reddit-lead-finder`
   - **Description**: `Intelligent Reddit marketing automation for TradingWizard.ai - finds opportunities and generates value-first replies`
   - **Visibility**: 
     - ✅ **Public** (recommended - showcases your work)
     - OR Private (if you prefer)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code (1 minute)

GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead (customized for your project):

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs/reddit_lead_finder

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (REPLACE 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-lead-finder.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

**Or if you prefer SSH**:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/reddit-lead-finder.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets for Automation (2 minutes)

To enable automated daily scans with GitHub Actions:

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   `https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-lead-finder/settings/secrets/actions`

2. **Click "New repository secret"**

3. **Add these secrets**:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
   - Value: Your Reddit client_id (from https://reddit.com/prefs/apps)
   
   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Value: Your Reddit client_secret

4. **Click "Add secret"** for each

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions (30 seconds)

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
3. Your scheduled scan will now run daily at 9 AM UTC!

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works (1 minute)

1. **Check Actions tab**: You should see the workflow
2. **Manually trigger a test**:
   - Go to Actions → "Reddit Lead Finder - Scheduled Scan"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select "main" branch
   - Click "Run workflow"
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** and check if it completes successfully

## 🎯 Quick Copy-Paste Commands

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username:

```bash
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs/reddit_lead_finder
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-lead-finder.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: HTTPS (Simpler)
- Use personal access token instead of password
- Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Permissions needed: `repo` (full control)

### Option 2: SSH (More Secure)
- Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
- Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
- Use SSH remote URL

## 📊 What Happens After Push

Once pushed to GitHub, you'll have:

1. **Public Portfolio Piece**: Showcases your automation skills
2. **Automated Daily Scans**: GitHub Actions runs every day at 9 AM UTC
3. **Version Control**: Track changes, rollback if needed
4. **Collaboration**: Others can contribute improvements
5. **Free Hosting**: No server costs for automation

## ⚙️ Customizing the Schedule

To change when scans run, edit `.github/workflows/scheduled_scan.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # 9 AM UTC daily
```

Cron examples:
- `'0 */6 * * *'` = Every 6 hours
- `'0 9 * * 1-5'` = 9 AM UTC, Monday-Friday
- `'0 9,17 * * *'` = 9 AM and 5 PM UTC daily

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
→ Use HTTPS instead of SSH, or set up SSH keys

### "Authentication failed"
→ Use personal access token, not password
→ Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### "Repository not found"
→ Check repository name spelling
→ Ensure you created the repository on GitHub first

### GitHub Actions not running
→ Check if secrets are added correctly
→ Verify workflow is enabled in Actions tab

   ```
