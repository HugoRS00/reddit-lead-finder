## Scoring System üéØ

Each opportunity is scored 0-100 based on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Intent Match | 40% | Tool-seeking, how-to, problem-solving signals |
| Keyword Density | 20% | Number of matched keywords |
| Context Fit | 25% | Relevance to TradingWizard features |
| Freshness | 10% | How recent the post is |
| Subreddit Quality | 5% | Quality/relevance of subreddit |

**Minimum threshold**: 60 (configurable)

## Reply Philosophy üí°

Replies follow the **Help First, Pitch Second** approach:

1. **50% Value**: Concrete tips, mini-playbooks, actionable advice
2. **50% Soft Sell**: Natural mention of TradingWizard with CTA
3. **Disclosure**: Light disclosure when including links
4. **Zero Hype**: No buzzwords, no guarantees, no financial advice
5. **Respect Rules**: Omits links if self-promo is restricted

### Example Reply Variants

**Variant A** (Direct + Helpful):
> "If you're getting whipsawed, try adding an ATR filter‚Äîonly trade when volatility exceeds your threshold. Also, check if you're trading during choppy market hours. If you want a quick AI breakdown of your chart, you can try TradingWizard.ai's Chart Analyzer‚Äîjust upload a screenshot and it gives you a structured setup."

**Variant B** (Educational + Soft):
